Hi,there! This is Songjie.

I am currently a graduate student advised by Prof. [Youlong Wu](https://faculty.sist.shanghaitech.edu.cn/faculty/wyl/) at [ShanghaiTech University](https://www.shanghaitech.edu.cn/eng/), where I also received my bachelor's degree in 2020.

My research interests lie in Information Theory and Machine Learning with a focus on Semantic Communication, Representation Learning and Variational Inference.
